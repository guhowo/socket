                      A simple local socket programme

HOW IT WORKS?

You need to run the server programme before the client to make it works.

When you run the server program, it creates a socket and waits for connections. If you start it in the
background so that it runs independently, you can then start clients in the foreground.

$ ./server &
[1] 5515
$ Waiting for client...

Now, when you run the client program, you are successful in connecting to the server. Because the
server socket exists, you can connect to it and communicate with the server.

$./client
Waiting for client...
char from server : B

./client & ./client & ./client
[2] 5601
[3] 5602
Waiting for client...
char from server : B
Waiting for client...
char from server : B
Waiting for client...
[2]-  Done                    ./client
char from server : B
[3]+  Done                    ./client

Remember that it’s good practice to remove a socket when you’ve finished with it, even if the
program terminates abnormally via a signal. This keeps the file system from getting cluttered with
unused files.
