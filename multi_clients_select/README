Multipule clients?

I do not think so. When you run this version of the server, it deals with multiple clients sequentially in a single process. 
The following is the result I run the program.

[guh@localhost multi_clients_select]$ ./server &
[1] 20031
[guh@localhost multi_clients_select]$ ./client & ./client & ./client & ./client
[2] 20032
[3] 20033
[4] 20034
client fd = 3
add a client socket on fd: 4
client fd = 3
client fd = 3
client fd = 3
add a client socket on fd: 5
add a client socket on fd: 6
B
add a client socket on fd: 7
B
[2]   Done                    ./client
[guh@localhost multi_clients_select]$ B
B

As what you see above, it take the server more than 20 seconds to deal with four clients. Later I will try to push a multi-threads version.
